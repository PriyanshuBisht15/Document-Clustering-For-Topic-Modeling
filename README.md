# 📚 Topic Modeling and Document Clustering

This project applies **Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA)** and **K-Means Clustering** to group similar documents for topic modeling and understanding large text corpora.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to extract meaningful topics from a collection of documents and visualize clusters using machine learning techniques. It involves preprocessing textual data, applying LDA for topic modeling, and using K-Means with PCA for clustering and visualization.

---

## 📁 Files Included

- `Enhanced_Topic_Modeling_Project.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook with full implementation
- `preprocessed_final.csv` — Preprocessed dataset used for modeling *(make sure it's uploaded if cloning)*
- `README.md` — Project documentation

---

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- **Python** (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- **NLP Libraries**: `nltk`, `gensim`
- **Clustering**: `scikit-learn` (KMeans, PCA)
- **Topic Modeling**: `gensim.models.LdaModel`, `pyLDAvis` for visualization
